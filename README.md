## üìñ Description

*JUL14Ns Audio Mods* is a plugin for TeamSpeak 3 that adds a few features to the audio system.
It allows you to filter background noise using the [RNNoise](https://jmvalin.ca/demo/rnnoise/) library, adds a configurable voice activation detection, and a compressor that does not lift noise to infinity.
